                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>Hi there! I'm GC Mouli, a tech enthusiast with over 20 years of experience in product management and engineering leadership. I currently work at Microsoft and have a Ph.D. from the University of South Florida in computer engineering.</p>
                <p>Over the years, I've had the chance to build and lead amazing global teams across B2B, B2C, and B2B2C in Large Enterprise companies and startups. I have realized in recent years that I have maximum satisfaction at the intersection of people, product, and technology.</p>
                <p>I mentor junior product managers and coach senior startup folks. Passionate about storytelling and writing, I'm currently retelling the Tamil epic novel Ponniyin Selvan in English.</p>
                <p>I'm super interested in company cultures, career arcs, people, behaviors, personalities, and I learn all this from meeting people over breakfast.</p>
