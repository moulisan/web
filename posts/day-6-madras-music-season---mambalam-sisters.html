<h1>Day 6: Madras Music Season - Mambalam Sisters</h1>
            Totally unplanned concert. Today was supposed to be a day of rest for me. But then, amma realized that, Mambalam Sisters were singing in PSBB school (KK Nagar). Too close to miss. In a way, I think I am thankful that we did not miss it. Awesome concert.

<li>
  Went a little late.
 </li>
<li>
  Awesome concert.
 </li>
<li>
  Trivia - Father - Ganjira - Two daughters singing, and third daughter on the violin - it was a whole family singing.
 </li>
<li>
  They sang the thirupugazh of the day - very traditional - I like it.
 </li>
<li>
  It has been a long time since I heard Chalamelara.
 </li>
<li>
  Main ghana ragam was Sankarabharanam - Akshaya Linga (today was Arudhra Darshanam).
 </li>
<li>
  Begabaro was a nice fast paced composition.
 </li>
<li>
  Manu pugazh Kosalaithan - a nice lullaby put everybody into a swaying mood (yes - the kknagar mami's also sway!)
 </li>
</ul>
PS: I leave back to Bangalore tomorrow late night 11PM Volvo - There is a decision that still needs to be taken for tomorrow - TVSankaranarayanan at Gorodia School (or) Sanjay Subramanyam at PSBB KKNagar school
