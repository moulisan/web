<h1>The CEO who did demos</h1>
            Yeah, you know who I am talking about. Steve Jobs. I was reading the
<a href="http://donmelton.com/">
 blog
</a>
of Don Melton (who led the first Safari development team), where he describes the feeling of being in the audience of rehearsals of the 'master presenter'.
<blockquote>
 Most of the time during those rehearsals, Ken and I had nothing to do except sit in the then empty audience and watch The Master Presenter at work — crafting his keynote. What a privilege to be a spectator during that process. At Apple, we were actually all students, not just spectators. When I see
 <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/1/8/3850056/qualcomms-insane-ces-2013-keynote-pictures-tweets">
  other companies clumsily announce products
 </a>
 these days, I realize again how much the rest of the world lost now that Steve is gone.
</blockquote>
And then there was also a link to the 2003 macworld keynote where Steve released Safari. I liked the way he demo'd Safari. It was typical Steve. Superlative adjectives. Practised fluency. But, what came next was what blew my mind. Steve also announces Keynote on the same presentation. My rough transcription:
<blockquote>
 The folks at apple created Keynote for me. I needed something that I can use to create these keynote presentations for you. Very graphic intensive. Powerful. Something that you want to use to create meaningful presentations. Now, &lt;pause&gt;, I want to share it with you. &lt;applause&gt;

This has been in the works for over a year now. For a year, we hired a very lowly paid beta tester, who tested it for a whole year. &lt;screen shows Steve Job's picture&gt; &lt;applause&gt;. I have used Keynote for every keynote that I showed you in 2002.
</blockquote>
I think that is just amazing. A CEO who not only demos, but also beta tested a product for a whole year. And not in his own private tasks, but for a very public demonstration. Amazing.
