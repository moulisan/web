<h1>Breathing life into animation</h1>
            What happens when you put a team of physicists, biologists, AI (artificial intelligence) scientists, and software engineers in a room? Pretty incredible things actually. In the following video, where Torsten Reil unveils the kinds of beautiful mix of genetic algorithms, simulations of the human neural systems, and how they work with the motor sensors of our body. This could create some awesome things. Some applications he reveals are:
<ol>
<li>
  More realistic video games
 </li>
<li>
  Animated stunt men for dangerous stunts in movies (being blown by dynamite etc)
 </li>
<li>
  Helping surgeons predict outcome of operations for cerebral palsy etc.
 </li>
</ol>
Look at the video for some breathtaking animations.

Pretty incredible eh?  Brilliant, I should say. Torsten has realized that, this is has economic potential and has started his own company called Natural Motion. Go to his website

<strong>
 Update:
</strong>
While you are there at the naturalmotion.com website, check out both the euphoria demo and the backbreaker demo. You do not need to download the demo and see. Just click on the embedded videos.
<strong>
 Update2:
</strong>
I also see on the website, that this technology is already into some xbox and PS3 games. That is what gives these games a realistic edge.
