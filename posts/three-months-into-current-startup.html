    <h1>Three Months into my current startup gig</h1>

    It is going to be 3 months (to the date, today) since I joined my current gig - the mythical beast - a consumer AI startup in stealth. 
    Early stage startups are all about excitement, building from scratch, seeing things come up from nothing, users finding joy in using what
    you build, and just the sheer adrenaline rush. Startups are also about chaos, extra long hours, the push towards shipping, looking at 
    every early users behavior, iterating and refining, and just, well, the same adrenaline rush. 
    </p>

    <p>

    This is not for everybody. And only those who enjoy this, will thrive. And no, I am not advocating for everyone to do 70 hours or 7 days/wk or 
    whatever the latest meme is about. It is about balancing your exertion, with rest and breaks. And then you do it all over again. 
    </p>

    I was recently telling our founderPG, that I must have shipped probably more in the last 3 months, than what I shipped in the last 2 years in my last gig. ðŸ˜Š

    <p>
        If you want a seat in this rocketship - we are looking for a front-end ninja, a back-end geek, an AI/data wizard, 
        <s>and a rockstar designer (who can sprint as fast as the rest of the team, and still maintain sanity).</s> 
        We closed on a designer yesterday, yaay! All of these roles require 7-10 years of experience, and a bunch of those working in high-pace startup-ish environs. 
        Biggest perk - working with an amazing all-star team distributed between the Bay Area and Bangalore. 
        Needs to be local in Bangalore (no remote).
