<h1>How to beat Jet Lag</h1>
            I think I have finally figured it out. I have been doing it for a couple of times now, but I think it is time that I know for sure, because I consciously tested my principles this time during my recent trip from New Delhi (India) to San Francisco. Flight was from Delhi to Singapore, to Seoul, and then to San Francisco.

I would have wanted to say, it was a late night flight from there, but I have figured out that, this detail does not really matter.
<ul>
<li>
  People tell you to either 'always sleep' during flights when you lose time, and 'always keep awake' when you gain time etc. Believe nothing of it.
  <strong>
   Sleep when you feel sleepy and wake up when you feel fresh
  </strong>
  . Simple, but pretty logic defying. You make sure you mind does not fool you into thinking, it is not day time over the area on which you are flying etc, just sleep when your body is tired ! Thats it !
 </li>
<li>
  As for feeling jet lagged  when you land, that is the problem of you having slept and woken up and spent 18 hours in an uncomfortable positioned seat. This in itself will bring upon a tiredness, and
  <strong>
   you will fall asleep automatically
  </strong>
  when you get to your hotel bed (or home whatever).
 </li>
<li>
  However bad and
  <em>
   unrecognizable
  </em>
  airline food maybe,
  <strong>
   eat all the stuff in the food tray
  </strong>
  . To follow point number, to sleep whenever you feel sleepy, you need to fool your stomach too. Eat regular food, and you will feel good, and fall asleep soon after.
 </li>
<li>
<strong>
   Gross tip warning:
  </strong>
  If you are going to be eating regularly and sleeping regularly, you need to visit the crap tank regularly.
  <strong>
   Do not try and avoid the toilet during your 18 hour flight.
  </strong>
  This will make your stomach heavy and hence you will not feel hungry the next meal, and hence you will not sleep well, when your body is tired. The trick is to fool your body as though nothing happened.
 </li>
</ul>
Try these tips, and let me know if they worked. It sure worked like a charm for me.

Note1: I will try these tips again when I travel back to New Delhi

Note2: This is not an april fools post :)
