<h1>Empathy and PMs</h1>
            
I have been thinking about this word for quite a bit of time these days. Whenever I am talking to folks and describing my definition of being a Product Manager - almost every trait distills down to this one word - Empathy.

Now, let me try and recollect and jot them down here -
<ol>
<li>
  Stakeholder management - One of the key traits that I believe a PM should have. The cliche' phrase of PM being the CEO of a product, imho loosely translates to this. Unless you are empathetic to the various parties (product, tech, marketing, operations, leadership, ...), you will not be able to get them on to the same page. You need to empathetic to the tech team as to why they are resisting a decision ~ perhaps this would involve tossing out a lot of code that they just wrote; you need to understand how they feel. You need to be empathetic to the operations team ~ perhaps they are short staffed during a certain time and they cannot handle so many escalations. You need to feel this issue. And so on.
 </li>
<li>
  Customer empathy - this is a given. A PM should be the biggest voice of the customer within the company. This might be a bit contrary to the first point, but customer empathy trumps empathy within the teams. You do not care if code needs to be rewritten, or more support staff needs to be hired, but if the customer experience is affected, it is unacceptable.
 </li>
<li>
  Strategy Roadmapping  - this is empathy at a different plane. A product leader needs to sense the emotions of the founding/executive team and the investors (if any), to see what would deliver the best RoI for these stakeholders. Too aggressive a roadmap might seem awesome to the investors, but not to the leadership team, but too sluggish a roadmap might make the investors lose confidence. This is extremely important. This is in most cases unspoken and very subtle.
 </li>
<li>
  Project Management - lets face it. This is a part of a Product Managers job ~ in varying degrees depending on the org. Good PMs exhibit a bias towards action(shipping) and make a dent here. While strategy/road-mapping is part of steering the ship, project

   management

  is choreographing the drum-beat of releases. You cannot do either of these without a deep sense of empathy to the executors.
 </li>
</ol>
And for those who are wondering if empathy is a key trait only for PMs, nope, check out Rand Fishkin's

where he says -

 The best skill I’ve developed and the one that’s served me best as a founder, a CEO, and a marketer is empathy.
