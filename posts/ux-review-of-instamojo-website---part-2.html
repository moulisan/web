<h1>UX review of Instamojo website - part 2</h1>
<strong>
 Creating a payment link (continued)
</strong>
After you have dragged and dropped the digital goods, it would be nice if you could say that, upload would happen later. Since I did not see any upload status scroll, I assumed, but in perfect design, nothing should be left for assumption.
<p>
When uploading a preview image, can you probably preview the image immediately - like you did for the PAN card upload? That would be nicer. Else, the same ambiguity/assumption as previous point happens here also.

<p>I tried making it pay what you want and wanted to put a base price of Rs.5. I got the below. Firstly, I do not understand why the Rs.9 restriction. Secondly base_price seems to be the variable name. You should make it Base price.

</a>
<p>I wanted to do the “Pay What you Want” model. And below is how it looks. It is not immediately apparent to my customer (who want to buy the book) as to what “minimum Rs.10 is”. Is there any way you can indicate what the publisher means by “Pay what you want”? Perhaps by putting a note below the “pay button” saying - “The seller has indicated this to be a ‘Pay what you want’. The seller can pay how much ever he/she wishes to pay over the base price indicated above”.

<p>I tried finishing up my profile, and I added my photo to my profile. Again, I wish you could immediately preview the pic.

</a>
<p>And oh, after a while, after I finished typing up my bio etc, I got the below. Looks like you were uploading the photo in the background - which is good - but it would be nice if I get some indication as a user.

  Love love love the analytics page. Super awesome. One small pet peeve - please please give me a refresh button. I do not want to refresh my page each time I want to see. I usually have all my analytics page open. And want to be able to refresh on demand.

<p>Hmm. Analytics and Advanced Analytics are the same?? They atleast seem to lead to the same page.

 UX flow issue leading into the app store
</strong>
<p>Before I click on the app store
<a href="https://gcmouli.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/insta20.jpg">
<img alt="insta20" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3763" height="275" src="https://gcmouli.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/insta20.jpg" width="770"/>
</a>
<p>I now click on App store
<a href="https://gcmouli.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/insta21.jpg">
<img alt="insta21" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3764" height="327" src="https://gcmouli.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/insta21.jpg" width="749"/>
</a>
Ideally by now, the Advanced Analytics should be ‘de-highlighted’ and App Store should be highlighted and some form of a landing page for app store should have come in the main body frame. However, you see above that two selections are highlighted and the previous (stale?) selection is still active on the right main body panel.
<p>
I went into the app store, and I see a bunch of apps there already. One big UI nitpick I have. The cards should all be same size and aligned.
<a href="https://gcmouli.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/insta22.jpg">
<img alt="insta22" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3765" height="590" src="https://gcmouli.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/insta22.jpg" width="755"/>
</a>
<p>And in general, I feel that the apps concept seems to be a little more of an advanced concept. And perhaps you should have a separate tutorial/documentation for this. Could not find it on the site.
