<h1>Fleeing Computer Science</h1>
            We have been hearing for some time now about students not choosing computer science as a major in the United States. Now, the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM), and IEEE-CS have teamed up to prepare a brochure aimed at high school students to gear them up and encourage them to take up Computer Science.

Two interesting points I saw in this

:

   At Stanford, CS has dropped from being the second largest major to the seventh. Often they end up in the economics or biology departments instead, not necessarily because they want to become economists or biologists, but because they're following the money. Finance and health care are seen as more cutting edge.

   The work of computer scientists is highlighted as finding solutions to "real-world problems" in fields from robotics to digital forensics.
  </span>
</li>
</ul>
Does this study include only American citizens or does it involve the score of Indian students who go to the US of A for graduate studies. Also, it is very interesting to see the 'booming' of engineering colleges in India, and the number of CS majors in the country increasing.
