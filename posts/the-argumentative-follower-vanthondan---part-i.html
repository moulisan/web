<h1>The Argumentative Follower (Vanthondan) - Part I</h1>
            It was marriage day. It was celebrations all around. Nambi Aaruran looked around his familiar town of
<a href="https://www.google.co.in/maps/place/Thirunavalur,+Tamil+Nadu+607204/@11.7475671,79.3912841,14z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x3a54acc74edbf34f:0xaf09562f421d0196">
<em>
  Thirunaavalur

</a>
with its festivities. It was a time, when a marriage in town meant celebrations for the entire town or village. It was getting closer to the
<em>
 Muhurtha
</em>
time - the time when he would tie the
<em>
 maangalyam
</em>
, and officially declared wedded.
<p>
There was a commotion in the crowd, and Nambi saw someone walking in from the entrance towards the dias. It was an old man. He walked with a stick. He was brisk though. The age did not show in his pace. Something about him was divine, but Nambi could not figure out what it was. Nambi wondered who this mysterious fellow was, and why he was causing a ruckus here.
<p>
He stood in front of the crowd and with a booming voice said -
<blockquote>
 Hear Ye, one and all. I have something to say before the wedding happens. This man here, and he consulted his olai (leaf scroll) and paused for a dramatic effect, Nambi, is a slave to me.
</blockquote>
He let the confusion sink in for a while. A fine orator he was, for he knew, when to get the audience engaged and when to stop. In his booming voice he continued, "So it says, in this parchment, which was signed by his grandfather."
<p>
Nambi was furious. He hissed at the old man - "Who are you, and where are you from?", to which the Brahmin responded, he was from the adjoining village,
<a href="https://www.google.co.in/maps/place/Thiruvennainallur,+Tamil+Nadu+607203/@11.8611988,79.3657064,16z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x3bab555b1ae79d7f:0x3937ae7b85590457">
 Thiruvennainallur
</a>
. Nambi then roared in laughter, "You, my dear friend, must be stark raving mad (afflicted by
<em>
 pitthu
</em>
)." He sized the old man  up and down, and hissed - "perhaps senility has set in at this old age of yours."
<p>
The old man smiled and responded by showing Nambi the parchment. Nambi's smile vanished on reading the parchment, which clearly mentioned that he was his slave. Nambi smile returned with an even more evil twist to it, and in a fit, he tore up the parchment, thinking he had destroyed all evidence.
<p>
The old man, in his booming voice, said - "This young whipper snapper thinks that, by destroying that parchment, he has gotten rid of the evidence. I knew this would happen, and that is why I brought a copy of the parchment, and not the original itself. The original is in Thiruvennainallur. The only way to settle this argument is to settle it in front of the elders of vennainallur.
<p>
Nambi did not have a choice. The entire crowd, along with Nambi followed the elderly brahmin to the adjoining village, where a village hearing was organized.
