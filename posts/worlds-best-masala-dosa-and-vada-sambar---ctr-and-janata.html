<h1>Worlds best Masala Dosa and Vada Sambar - CTR and Janata</h1>
<p style="text-align:left;">
 My wife and I are proper foodies. We just love food - any food (anything vegetarian that is). The facilities/admin manager at my workplace knows that -since I am probably the only guy who goes and thanks him for the good free food we get :) Anyways, he has been telling me of a couple of really old food joints in one of the core kannadiga-heartlands of Bangalore - Malleswaram (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malleshwara ). It is where True Bangalore lives. Beautiful, breezy, clean, no pollution. Nice. Anyways, getting back to food, He had mentioned two joints, each famous for different things.
</p>
The first was CTR - Central Tiffin Room, aka CTR. Apparently the name board alone has changed to Sree Sagar. Why do I say - apparently? Because the new name board is written fully in Kannada as well. So I would not have realized it either ways. My dear manager friend had given me spot-on directions, to reach the place, and even where to park (opposite side of the road - near the ground periphery - the cops ticket you if you park on the hotel road). But he had not mentioned how big/small it was. If you are going there for the first time, I am pretty sure, you will miss the hotel in the first go (like we did). But ask anyone, they will point you to the hole-in-the-wall entrance.

 You will defenitely miss it, if you do not know how to read Kannada.

 The worlds best butter masala dosa (benne masala dose).
</em>
Once the dosa had been gulped down, it was time to go to the second joint that my manager friend had recommended - Hotel Janata - famous for its Vada Sambar. You need to walk down to eigth cross for this (CTR is in 7th Cross). It is but a 10 minute walk. It is difficult to miss this hotel though. English name board and prominently displayed too.

All in all, what started off as a 'what-the-he**, let us just try these places today' morning, became a wonderful morning spent on delectable kannadiga good.
