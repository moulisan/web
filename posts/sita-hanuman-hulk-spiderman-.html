<h1>Sita, Hanuman, Hulk, Spiderman ...</h1>
            
I usually do not forward or propagate 'forward-emails' - emails which say that, this happened to my friends brothers sister-in-law. But this one brought with it major entertainment. This is about a little girl who went for a UKG interview in one of the premeire schools in Chennai. The Principal asks the girl to tell a story, to which the kid asks if she can narrate a story that she has written, or a story that she has just read. The surprised Principal asks her to read the story that she had written. If this is really true, God bless the kid - she is going to go places.
<br/>
<blockquote>
<div>
  Ok, tell me story which you have written.

Sarithra said "Ravanan kidnapped Sita to Srilanka"
<p>
Opening scene failed to impress the Principal but still she encouraged the child to continue.
<p>
"Rama asked Hanuman's help to rescue Sita. Hanuman too agreed to help Rama "
<p>
"Then?"
<p>
"Now, Hanuman called his friend Spider man." No one expected this twist in the story
<p>
"Why?"
<p>
"Because there are lot of mountains between India and Srilanka..if we have Spiderman we can go easily with his rope."
<p>
"But Hanuman can fly isn't it??"
 </p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>
<div>
</div>
<div>
  "Yes. But he is having Sanjeevi Mountain on one hand, so he cannot fly very fast. "
 </div>
<div>
  "Hanuman and Spiderman flew to Srilanka and rescued Sita. Sita said Thanks to both"
  <p>
"Why?"
<p>
"When you are helped you should say Thanks"
<p>
"Hanuman now called Hulk."
<p>
All were surprised. She realized our curiosity and said " Now Sita is there, so to take her safely back to Rama..he called Hulk"
<p>
"What logic???" the Principal asked.
<p>
"Hanuman can carry Sita right?"
<p>
"Yes. But he has Sanjeevi Mountain in one hand and has to hold spider man on the other"
<p>
The Principal could not control her smiles. " So when they all started to India they met my friend Akshay"
<p>
"How come Akshay there now?"
<p>
"Because it is my story and I can bring any one there"
<p>
Now the Principal didn't get angry but waited for the next twist
<p>
Then all started to India and landed at Chennai's Velechery bus stop
<p>
Now I asked,"Why they have landed In Velechery bus stop? "
<p>
"Because they forgot the way..&amp; Hulk got an idea and called Dora"
<p>
"Dora came and she took Sita to Velechery Venus Colony...that's all."
 </p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>
<div>
</div>
<div>
  Finished the story with a smile

Now the Principal asked "Why Venus Colony?"
<p>
"Because sita is there &amp; I am Sita!!!"
 </p></div>
