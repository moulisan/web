<h1>Storytelling in Tech</h1>
<p>

</p>
The power and impact of story telling gives me a high that most other things don't match up to. At work, we were talking about 
a large scale infra modernization project. This is about as tech-focused and dry as it could get. We were discussing how to 
present it to leadership. 

<p>
Challenge accepted. 
</p>
<ol>
<li>Infra architecture was working perfectly fine. </li>
<li>Until one day, a capacity issue hit; and we had to go do some remediation to fix it. </li>
<li>And then a few days later, more traffic, more issues. It was not our issue, but we were downstream, so we had to step in and help fix. </li>
<li>And this started happening on a semi-frequent scale. </li>
<li>Until one day, we just decided to overhaul some parts of the architecture (which was quite old). </li>
<li> <b> .. mini story .. </b> A series of "How things are, now?" and "How it could become." </li>
<li>Get LT approval</li>
<li>We are in the middle of the overhaul and we track progress and report success incrementally</li>
<li>And we should be back in peaceful infra architecture land. </li>
</ol>
See, what I did there? 
<p>
It is a combination of Hero's journey, Pixar's framework, and Nancy Duartes technique.
<p>
So, thats how it's done folks. :-)
