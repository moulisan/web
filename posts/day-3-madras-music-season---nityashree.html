<h1>Day 3: Madras Music Season - Nityashree.</h1>
<p>
 Decided in the morning to attend Nityashree at Rani Seethai Hall. Concert was at 6:15PM. The previous concert was a free concert by an upcoming singer - Ravikiran. He was pretty good. Nityashree started the concert bang on time. Following are my observations:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
  Very impressive concert.
 </li>
<li>
  Full throated singing - though she has started modulating her position with respect to the mike, so it has become more pleasurable than previous years.
 </li>
<li>
  Started off with a brisk varnam - Thodi. Was awesome.
 </li>
<li>
  Nannu brovu Lalitha in ragam lalitha was beautiful. In general, it is one of my favourite ragams.
 </li>
<li>
  Some new raagams featured were - Karna ranjani and Jayantasena - both very pleasing to hear.
 </li>
<li>
  Pasupatheeswaram in Shubhapanthuvarali was rendered with passion.
 </li>
<li>
  Aadum deviam nee (kambhoji) was the ghana raagam.
 </li>
<li>
  A high paced Velan Varuvaaradi made people sit up, after the thani avarthanam.
 </li>
<li>
  The tempo was beautifully modulated with a melodious Sarvam Brahma Mayam (Madhuvanthi)
 </li>
<li>
  A quick thukada was in order - Ramanai Bhajital (maandu)
 </li>
<li>
  The concert was nicely concluded with a thillana in Ananda Bhairavi
 </li>
<li>
  All in all, a good concert. Packed hall. Thunderous applause.
 </li>
<li>
  She still, however has something very amusing going on, on the top right side of the ceiling, which she keeps beckoning, whenever she goes high pitched :-)
 </li>
</ul>
