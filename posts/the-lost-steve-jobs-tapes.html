<h1>The Lost Steve Jobs Tapes</h1>
<blockquote>
<strong>
  f Steve Jobs's life were staged as an opera,
 </strong>
 it would be a tragedy in three acts. And the titles would go something like this: Act I--
 <em>
  The Founding of Apple Computer and the Invention of the PC Industry
 </em>
 ; Act II--
 <em>
  The Wilderness Years
 </em>
 ; and Act III--
 <em>
  A Triumphant Return and Tragic Demise
 </em>
 .

The first act would be a piquant comedy about the brashness of genius and the audacity of youth, abruptly turning ominous when our young hero is cast out of his own kingdom. The closing act would plumb the profound irony of a balding and domesticated high-tech rock star coming back to transform Apple far beyond even his own lofty expectations, only to fall mortally ill and then slowly, excruciatingly wither away, even as his original creation miraculously bulks up into the biggest digital dynamo of them all. Both acts are picaresque tales that end with a surge of deep pathos worthy of Shakespeare.

But that second act--
 <em>
  The Wilderness Years
 </em>
 --would be altogether different in tone and spirit. In fact, the soul of this act would undermine its title, a convenient phrase journalists and biographers use to describe his 1985 to 1996 hiatus from Apple, as if the only meaningful times in Jobs's life were those spent in Cupertino. In fact, this middle period was the most pivotal of his life. And perhaps the happiest. He finally settled down, married, and had a family. He learned the value of patience and the ability to feign it when he lost it. Most important, his work with the two companies he led during that time, NeXT and Pixar, turned him into the kind of man, and leader, who would spur Apple to unimaginable heights upon his return.

A Must Read for anyone who is an Apple Fan, or for that matter, anyone who wants to understand the power of self-improvement. Beautiful.
