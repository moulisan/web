<h1>Cargo Cult Science</h1>
            All of us have read the Steve Jobs Commencement speech (the one he says that we have to connect the dots backwards). But has anyone read this amazing commencement speech by Richard Feynman (1974 - Caltech). Brilliant in one word, is how I would put it.

An excerpt:
<span>
</span>
<span>
 I think the educational and psychological studies I mentioned  are examples of what I would like to call cargo cult science.  In the  South Seas there is a cargo cult of people.  During the war they saw  airplanes with lots of good materials, and they want the same thing to  happen now.  So they've arranged to make things like runways, to put fires along the sides of the runways, to make a wooden hut for a man  to sit in, with two wooden pieces on his head to headphones and bars  of bamboo sticking out like antennas--he's the controller--and they wait  for the airplanes to land.  They're doing everything right.  The form  is perfect.  It looks exactly the way it looked before.  But it doesn't  work.  No airplanes land.  So I call these things cargo cult science,  because they follow all the apparent precepts and forms of scientific  investigation, but they're missing something essential, because the  planes don't land.
</span>

 Now it behooves me, of course, to tell you what they're missing.   But it would be just about as difficult to explain to the South Sea  islanders how they have to arrange things so that they get some wealth  in their system.  It is not something simple like telling them how to  improve the shapes of the earphones.  But there is one feature I notice  that is generally missing in cargo cult science.  That is the idea that  we all hope you have learned in studying science in school--we never  say explicitly what this is, but just hope that you catch on by all the  examples of scientific investigation.  It is interesting, therefore,  to bring it out now and speak of it explicitly.  It's a kind of scientific  integrity, a principle of scientific thought that corresponds to a kind of utter honesty--a kind of leaning over backwards.  For example, if you're doing an experiment, you should report everything that you think  might make it invalid--not only what you think is right about it:   other causes that could possibly explain your results; and things you  thought of that you've eliminated by some other experiment, and how  they worked--to make sure the other fellow can tell they have been eliminated.
