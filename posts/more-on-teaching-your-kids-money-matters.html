<h1>More on teaching your kids money-matters</h1>
            As a followup to a post on Dec 4 about spilling the money guts, I read today in
<a href="http://www.pfadvice.com">
 pfadvise
</a>
which said it all. The author was wanting to write an article on why we should teach our kids about finances - and since he did not have kids, he goes to a friends place who has a teen, who was an expert in finances at home.

Read the
<a href="http://www.pfadvice.com/2005/12/07/or-let-your-childred-teach-you/">
 full article
</a>
to see how the author was pleasantly surprised.
<blockquote>

  As I was thanking my friend for his help and about to leave, we heard a voice from the other room. "Don't forget to turn off the lights when you're done in there," his son reminded. My friend rolled his eyes and I laughed. It was the only time I've ever heard a kid reminding their parents to turn off the lights and I guess that in itself says it all.
