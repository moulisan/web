<h1>Auto logic</h1>
            Do not let the title confuse you. I am not going to talk about any psychological theory, nor any neurolinguistic programming stuff. This is mainly nuggets of information, that I catch from auto-rikshaw drivers, in my travels within Bangalore. My wife tells me that, I have this knack to get people talking, and I think I agree with that. I am going to catalog interesting bits of my dialogues with these khakhi uniformed men in their mean yellow-and-black driving machines.

In todays edition, I will recapture the conversation from yesterdays ride between Domlur and Koramangala. (I have translated from tamil to English here)
<blockquote>
<strong>
  Auto-driver
 </strong>
 : Look at that moron, honking, when the light is still red.
 <strong>
  Me
 </strong>
 : Yeah, crazy guy.
 <strong>
  Auto-driver
 </strong>
 : Put the same guy in foreign (meaning any foreign country), the guy will behave
 <em>
  degently
 </em>
 (decently). Why, only here, he is like this. *shaking head*
</blockquote>
There is a pearl of wisdom (and truth) in what he says. I have heard this from a lot of folks, but to hear that from an auto-driver was revealing/shocking.
