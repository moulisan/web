<h1>Golden Quadrilateral Project features in a NY Times article</h1>
            A nicely written by rather lengthy article (read 7 pages) in NY Times details how India is building its roads slowly. The British concentrated on building the Rail network in India (which I must admit, they did very well - seeing the extremely vast system that is present today - read the

 wiki page
</a>
). The last time, roads were buit in such a grand scale was ages ago - when Sher Shah Suri built the

 Grand Trunk Road
</a>
(GT Road). The previous goverment in India, led by Vajpayee of the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BJP">
 BJP
</a>
party had kick started this project of building a vast highway network. This project was to connect the 4 large metro cities of Delhi, Mumbai (Bombay), Chennai (Madras), and Kolkata (Calcutta) by 4-lane and 6-lane super highways. Governments have changed, but thankfully, most of the projects are still going on. This was mainly because Vajpayee had established an autonomous body to oversee this project. I personally have been some stretches of this road network - and I should say, it is a pleasure to drive on these roads.

I do not totally agree to some of the points made in the article, but then it is written by an observer/reporter who spent one month in India and wrote the article. I would excuse and forgive him, for the reason, that, he only wrote what he observed.
