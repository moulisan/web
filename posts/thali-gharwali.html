<h1>Thali Gharwali</h1>
            On Saturday, I had lunch at Purabhi's Dal Roti - one of our favourite restaurants in Koramangala (R loves it there too). I had originally thought I would have their delicious parathas - two parathas served and they are huge (defenitely worth the money - and they are reasonable too!). Then I chanced to see the
<strong>
 Thali Gharwali
</strong>
. For some reason, R and I have always skipped this.

Today, I was in the mood for a square meal, or a um, round meal, sure whatever. And the thali it was. I know the manager of this restaurant well (yeah yeah, I know, it is because we have frequented this place too often in the past!). So he came and kushalam vijaarichified (*). I asked what was there in the thali today. And he said, good stuff and made the A-OK sign with his fingers. I said "
<em>
 Bring it on!".
</em>
The perfect meal:
<ul>
<blockquote>
<li>
   - 3 phulkas
  </li>
<li>
   - 1 katori dal makhani (the dal makhani here is the best I have tasted in Bangalore)
  </li>
<li>
   - 1 katori jeera aaloo
  </li>
<li>
   - 1 katori kadi pakodi (I am not a fan of kadi - so I fished out the pakodi and ate it ! :-))
  </li>
<li>
   - 1 katori pulao (only half cooked - typical of north Indian food !)
  </li>
<li>
   - 1 katori mixed raita (delicious tomatos and cucumbers, and very less onions)
  </li>
<li>
   - 1 lijjat papad
  </li>
</blockquote>
</ul>
On the whole, quantity which is just about right, and variety a plenty. I did not feel gluttonous after the meal. Perfecto. Kudos to the Dal Roti Chef.
<strong>
 Location of restaurant:
</strong>
Koramangala - on the road which leads to Sony world junction from Vivek Nagar/National Games Village. It is between the pizza hut junction and Sony world. It is on the first floor. The entrance is on a side road. It is easy to miss. Look out for their signboard (see below):
