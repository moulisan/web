<h1>Restaurant Review: Mezzeh Lebanese Lounge</h1>
<strong>
 Location
</strong>
: Great location - 80 ft Road Indiranagar, Bangalore. Between spencers and BSNL.
<strong>
 Ambience
</strong>
:  This is the terrace. There is minimal ambience. Few nice tables on the terrace. Nothing fancy at all here.
<p>
Crowd: It looks like original restaurant (World Cuisine Network) has been bought over by someone else, and the whole place is under renovation. There used to be 3 restaurants here. Now only the Mezzeh place remains.We went on friday afternoon, and there was nobody, and when I say nobody, I mean it. The 6 of us in our team were the only people who were there in the restaurant.
<p><strong>
 Food
</strong>
: The food was pretty good. Fairly authentic in taste. The hummus was good. The Baba ghanoush was passable (but that was probably because I am not a big fan of brinjal). The sambousik was very good stuff. The falafel rolls were pretty good too. The baklava was not that good. The biggest problem was the portion size. They have super small size portions. I mean, the sambousik's were gone in a minute. The hummus came with 2 pieces of pita bread. And when we asked for more, we were charged, and two more small pieces came !
<p><strong>
 Price
</strong>
: Too steep. Just not worth the small portions or the ambience.
<strong>
<p>Overall
</p></strong>
: The valet guy said that they are renovating and should open big again soon. My 2 cents - they retain the same chef/kitchen staff. They cut the prices and increase the portion sizes. Make the ambience a little more livelier. With the great location in Indiranagar, they could be doing great business.
