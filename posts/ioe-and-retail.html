<h1>IoE and Retail</h1>
            I read an article by Mala Anand (@malaAnandCisco) of Cisco on how Internet of Everything (IoE) can be harnessed for retail, and that got me thinking. This is another of those dream product posts that I occasionally write (dream-write?). There may be overlaps in some of the things that Mala had used, but this here post is my interpretation :)

My definition of IoE or IoT is the system where multiple devices capable of collecting, transmitting, and/or processing data, are interconnected towards achieving a specific result.

Let us take retail as an example, for the case of this blog post.

As you walk into the door, apps from your mobile phone could communicate to the store about the list of things that you are looking for. Perhaps at a high level, you walk into a super-store such as Star Bazaar in India, or Walmart in the US, and your intention is to buy some groceries and perhaps a dress for your nephew. One of these things could be done:
<ul>
<li>
  Your to-buy list could be transmitted to a central unit, which could dispatch a human personnel to you to guide you through buying your dress.
 </li>
<li>
  The store central unit sends the directions to your app indicating where the items you intending purchasing are stocked. It is worth mentioning here, that stores tend to keep changing their locations. So without the latest directions, you could be searching for a while.
 </li>
<li>
  If you have a long list of grocery items, the central system could guide the phone in your app to an optimized route.
 </li>
<li>
  If you have taken a shopping cart/trolley, the central system could now talk to a display on the trolley and guide you.
 </li>
<li>
  And ofcourse, let us toss in a bit of capitalism in here, judging you by your past behaviors, the system could 'surreptitiously' guide you to some items that you did not have on our list, but you crave/wish for. And ofcourse give you some deals while at it, to persuade you to buy it.
 </li>
<li>
  The system could also help you keep you within a budget - money-wise and time-wise.
 </li>
</ul>
And hey, while you were still at home, creating your to-buy list, your refrigerator could have let you know the status of milk and other staples at home, and if you need to purchase any.

While at the store, let us shift away from the customer experience, and move towards how it could potentially help the store itself.
<ul>
<li>
  Based on the sensors that could detect weather (current and predictions), the store manager could get data on if he should be stocking up on related items such as umbrellas, suntan lotion etc, and if he should be putting them up in the center aisles.
 </li>
<li>
  The temperature sensors could also optimally adjust the thermostats and lighting (this is already done by NEST kind of devices)
 </li>
<li>
  Stock inventory (weight sensors on the shelves) and Resource deployment could also be updated based on connected devices in the store.
 </li>
<li>
  Billing lines could be avoided - the connected devices would have calculated the bill, gotten the buyers approval and charged the credit card or deducted from an online wallet.
 </li>
<li>
  Connected cleaning agents such as robotized roombas could help clean the stores in co-ordination with the other systems in the store.
 </li>
<li>
  Connected cameras could potentially infer demographics of the customers visiting the stores. Example - Retired folks in a Target at St.Petersburg, Tampa would probably not be needing baseball bats and specialized soccer equipment. Golf clubs might be a better idea to stock.
 </li>
</ul>
These are some of the ideas that came up, off the top of my mind. But the Internet of Things is a very interesting subject and even though, much of it is made of dreams, there are promising directions that companies are headed towards, which makes all of these dreams potentially feasible in the not so distant future.
