<h1>Lack of Professionals blogging</h1>
            NY Times technology division has a nice write up on how and why there is a dearth of blogs about business travellers. After reading it, I would say that the reasons given are exactly the same reasons, why a large number of professionals in other fields also do not blog. We are always paranoid about our anonymity getting lost somewhere in the middle. For instance, one business traveller says that,  sometimes just disclosing which city I am visiting can give my competition ideas. These are just some ideas that float through all our minds. We would not be writing as candidly, if we knew our bosses were reading it. Add to the fact that there were a slew of people who got chucked out of their jobs after their employers found references to them in their blogs.

Oh well, do read the article though. It is a good read.
