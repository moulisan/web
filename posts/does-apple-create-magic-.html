<h1>Does Apple create Magic ?</h1>
            Lex friedman, in his article in MacWorld, has a beautiful piece on Apple. An excerpt below:
<blockquote>
 Apple uses the word "magical" a lot these days. It's enough to make you wonder if Steve Jobs dropped out of Hogwarts. The most magical item in Apple's endless bag of products is probably the iPad. Even before the tablet hit the shelves, chief operating officer Tim Cook was talking up the "magic of using [the iPad]” at an investors conference. For a time, Apple’s standard boilerplate at the end of each press release described the original iPad as magical.

It’s not just tablets, though—Apple sells products like the Magic Mouse and the Magic Trackpad. With the possible exception of Mr. Clean, no other non-legerdemain-focused company so consistently depicts its products as supernaturally enhanced.

As fond as Apple may be of promoting its products using terms of enchantment, I think it misses the point—and actually sells the company's efforts a bit short. Instead of “magical,” it's more accurate to describe Apple’s products as brilliantly and patiently engineered, with meticulous attention to detail.
