<h1>Thirunelveli (mostly in pictures)</h1>
            Did a weekend trip to Theeli (as the local sometimes refer Thiruneveli as). Travelled from Bangalore to Kumbakonam in the usual
<a href="http://indiarailinfo.com/train/mysore-mayiladuturai-express-16232-mys-to-sbc/1041/1430/136">
 Mayiladuthurai express
</a>
. And then drove down to Thirunelveli with the wife, kid and brother-in-law.

The route is Kumbakonam-Tanjavur-Trichy-Madurai-Virudhunagar-Sattur-Kovilpatti-Thirunelveli. Kumbakonam-Tanjavur is horrible road. Tanjavur-Trichy is passable (except for the heavy traffic). Trichy-Madurai is good quality road but still some twists and turns on the road. There is a Ghar Dhaba in the Madurai bypass where there are clean restrooms and you can get some food. Madurai-Thirunelveli is just a fantastic stretch to drive - straight road with beautiful road quality. It almost feels like you are driving in US - like in Nevada or somewhere. No vegetation. No habitation. For miles together. While you need to pass through Tanjore and Trichy (if you consider Tiruverumbur as part of Trichy), you will take bypass for all other towns such as Madurai and Virudhunagar.

The Nellaiappar temple is a huge temple, which is also very old. It is one of the paadal petra sthalangal (Tevara sthalangal). The temple was built by Koon Pandiyan - the Madurai king who was cured by Gnana Sambandhar. Nellaiappar and Gandhimathi Amman are housed in separate temples and the two temples are connected by a Sangili Mandapam - a connecting hallway.

A detailed post about the temple can be found here by suryakala
