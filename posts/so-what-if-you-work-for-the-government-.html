<h1>So what, if you work for the Government ...</h1>
            I thoroughly get bugged when I see bumper stickers (or rear windshield stickers) which proclaim what industry you are in.
<p>
So what if you work in the government? Do you have the sticker on so that the police should not catch you if you do not heed the traffic rules? If not why?
<p>
So what if you work for the government? Do you need preferential treatment? Why? If you need to prove your identity to get 'things done', you have already defeated the whole purpose. It means your governance is so bad that, you get things done, only if you have that sticker or the metal plate.
<p>
So what if someone you know or even you, are in the army. I have huge respect for folks in uniform. Please don't ruin it for me. I have had several people actually tell me that, they have the sticker so that the police do not 'bother' them. (Remember regular police cannot slap charges on these folks - only military police can).
<p>
So what if you are an advocate, are you threatening me that, if I get into an accident or altercation with you, you will drag me to court? Are you trying to tell me that you are a big guy? What is the purpose of that bow tie sticker on your vehicle. I am sure that is not a vehicle pass that lets you into court. You do have some other form of identification. Then what is the need for the neck tie sticker.
<p>
I dont even agree with the police sticker. I have seen folks who are software engineers riding bikes with a 'Police' sticker. When asked, they would give some vague answer as, their brother, who is an office, occasionally take their bike, but mostly it is so that, police do not 'bother' them. Wow. It bothers me though. If a police officer is really rushing to a place where he is urgently required, either he would be riding an official vehicle, run through traffic like Keanu Reaves, or grab some random persons car in the middle of the road like Chris Tucker. He is not riding his brothers bike.
<p>
The one profession sticker that I think 'could' potentially be useful is the doctor sticker. Even there, I use could the phrase "potentially" because this need not be the case all the time. But then I am willing to take the extreme case in this one. Perhaps, being a doctor, there may be times when you have to rush to a hospital to which you have been summoned.
<p>
Maybe I should just adjust maadi and make this sticker for myself:

<img alt="swengg" class="aligncenter wp-image-3538 size-full" height="135" src="https://gcmouli.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/swengg.png" width="746"/>
</a>
But then this would probably ensure that I get flagged by the police more. *Sigh*
