<h1>On adapting successful UX methods</h1>
            I notice User Experience (UX) differences and how they affect my productivity. I love products who focus on great UX. I love products who continually evolve their UX to become better and better. You know what I love even more - products who recognize good UX behaviors and adapt it to their own. And I recently came across a fine example of the latter - Twitter.

This is the android twitter app. Do you see the "New Tweets" button at the top. This is very new. Facebook has had this for ages (it is called "New Stories" and it the button has a more oval structure to it). Clicking on the "New Tweets" button lets you know that there are new tweets and that you can click on that to scroll up to the latest tweets. This also saves you a pull down gesture, which is kind-of hard to do if you are holding and operating your phone with one hand (which is a pretty common use case).

My principal point here is that, if you recognize a good UX mechanism, it is my personal believe that, there is nothing wrong in adapting the mechanism to your product (unless it is patented ofcourse). It helps standardize UX across classes of apps. There is also a sense of sharing between the companies. I am sure FB spent quite a bit of UX effort coming up with their equivalent.
<strong>
 Request:
</strong>
As always, I have one request, which I am sure Twitter will not see, but that is fine, I will indulge myself. I would love to see the "New Tweets" button enhanced with the number of new tweets  - example - "132 New Tweets". Twitter has the underlying algorithms for this, since it is present in their webapp.
