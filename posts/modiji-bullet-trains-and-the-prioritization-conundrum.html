<h1>Modiji, Bullet trains, and the Prioritization conundrum</h1>
            
PM Modi and the Japanese PM Abe jointly laid the foundation stone for the first bullet train in India. Enough has been ranted about this in social media. About, why this is not the thing that is needed now. And why the Govt should fix all the issues that is plaguing the railways and so on.
<p>
I think this is a problem that Product managers face too (Hmm. Just a coincidence that, they are PMs too.).
</p>
<p>
The feature prioritization conundrum is the scenario where a PM is faced with a host of small urgent + Important  issues/features to deliver in a short time-frame ; and a smaller bunch of longish important but more challenging hard problems to solve. The engineers want to do the latter, but the former are very important too.
</p>
<p>
A PM cannot keep prioritizing the smallish important problems higher, because they will never end. You will never get to the largish challenging problems. This will lead to your engineers getting demotivated and doing mundane familiar stuff. But at the same time, you cannot just prioritize the challenging projects - this will keep your engineers happy - but the business suffers. Some of these urgent+important tasks are most likely important for the business.
</p>
<p>
One of the solutions to this is to assign more than one task to engineers. This should be a mix of the smaller urgent tasks and the longish exciting tasks. This will keep your engineers happy and the business going.
</p>
<p>
So, does that make, what our Prime Minister did, with the bullet train right? I do not know, since I do not have enough context. But if I see the PM as a PM ( :-) ), then I guess he is doing the right thing.
