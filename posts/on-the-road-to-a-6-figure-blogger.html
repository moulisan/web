            No, I am not talking about me. I write for the pleasure of it, and for archiving these nuggets that I find on the web. I am talking about Steve Pavlina and his personal development blog. He claims that it is not (at the moment) his primary source of income ; but maybe next year it will be. November alone brought about $4700 through earnings on his website. He says that it is a 33x increase than his January 2005 earnings. At this rate, extrapolating, he claims that 'maybe' his 2006 earnings through the website would be about $100,000.
