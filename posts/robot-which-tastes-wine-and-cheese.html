 The Japanese have done it again. NEC labs and MIE University have prototyped a robot which can identify different wines and cheese. It does not taste it through the mouth however ... the tasting is done using an infrared spectrometer on its hand.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
  When it has identified a wine, the robot speaks up in a childlike voice. It names the brand and adds a comment or two on the taste, such as whether it is a buttery chardonnay or a full-bodied shiraz, and what kind of foods might go well on the side.
 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
 There are other things that the robot can do too, using this method. Check this one out for instance -
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
  Given three ripe, identical-looking apples to analyze, the robot was able without taking a bite to correctly single out one as sweet and the other two as a bit sour.
 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
 However, official tasters (or someliers as they are called) need not start sweating yet. The robot is still dumb in some aspects.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
  When a reporter's hand was placed against the robot's taste sensor, it was identified as prosciutto. A cameraman was mistaken for bacon.
 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
 I googled and found that a prosciutto is a type of Italian ham.
