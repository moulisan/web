<h1>Shock and Awe</h1>
            Oh yes, that is how I descibe it. After contemplating a lot on what and how to write this news, I just got down to writing it. Shock and awe indeed. And awe in the bad sense. How could the Nobel committee be so stupid! They are supposed to be the smartest people on earth. Cmon, they judge the world and give the award to the smartest people. People of the likes of Nelson Mandela (who fought for racial injustice) and Mother Theresa (who did so much to the City of Joy)
<strong>
 deserve
</strong>
the Nobel Peace Prize. I am not saying Obama will not. He has the right intentions. He has the right plans. But what the heck, he has not even started implementing them! And will he actually implement them? God knows.
<p>
Hypothetical scenario -- Lets say 3 years down the line, towards the end of his first term,
<p>
(1) he gets the entire army out of Iraq - meaning there are no more insurgencies, and a peaceful democratic government is ruling there;
<p>
(2) he gets the entire army out of Afghanistan, where a similar situation prevails;
<p>
(3) Peace prevails in Israel;
<p>
(4) He solves the 100 yr old border problem between India and Pakistan ;
<p>
(5) Tibet becomes an autonomous governing body either within China or within India, or a separate nation state like Bhutan.
<p>
Even if he does 3 out of the above 5, I will say that, he can
<p><strong>
 deserve
</strong>
the Nobel Peace Prize. For some reason, within myself, I will never see the Nobel Peace Prize the same way again.
<strong>
<p>It is diluted.
</p></strong>
<p>If he had even the slightest bit of honor in him, he would have declined it, and said, I will take it when I deserve it. His statement of "I do not deserve it, but I will take it", brought more anger to me. This is not a Cadbury Bournville Chocolate bar for heavens sake, it is a Nobel Peace Prize. Ok. now that I have gotten it out of my system, I will stop.
