<h1>The Argumentative Follower (Vanthondan) – Part 2</h1>

</p></strong>
<em>
 Nambi Arooran of Thirunaavalur is getting ready to get married. An old gentleman comes to the wedding venue and claims Nambi as his slave. He shows a parchment showing that his grandfather had indeed agreed to make his entire clan slave to the brahmin.
</em>
<p>
The village elders of Vennainallur gathered in front of the temple - where most disputes were settled. The elderly brahmin brought forth the original manuscript.
<blockquote>
 The brahmin turned to the village elders and said - "Please make sure this young fellow does not tear up this document also. It is your responsibility. "
</blockquote>
<p>
The contents of the manuscript were verified. The signature matched of some other records that had been preserved by the village authorities, and the case was settled. Nambi was now the old Brahmin's slave, and there was nothing he could do about it.
<p>
Sadness was wrought on Nambi's face. All of 16 years old, he was looking forward to the marriage and settling down to Grihastaashrama. He followed the old man towards the local Shiva temple, where he was to witness the miracle of miracles. The old man vanished into a blinding light as he approached the main sanctum sanctorum (garba griham).
<p>
It was then Nambi realized that the old man was none other Lord Shiva himself, and that the Lord had come down to earth to remind Nambi of his past at Kailasa and fulfill his task on earth.
