<h1>Food on Order Direct from Rooms</h1>
            I was thinking quite a bit about whether to write this as a post or to add on to the previous post, but I guess 'new post' won.

The one problem that a lot of service apartments face is the lack of a full fledged kitchen. There might be breakfast, but that would still be fairly minimal. In the US, when I go for a business visit, a lot of the hotels would have a menu of a near-by restaurant which would deliver ~ within certain working hours of course. Most times this is a little expensive, but there are days, when you just come back to your room and plop on your room (or the ottoman) and do not want to get up. You just want someone to come and give you the food in your room.

This should be feasible in India too right? A tie up with a nearby chain? In fact, with most of these chains going the app-way or have an online site where you can order, there exists infrastructure to make this more streamlined.
<ol>
<li>
  There could be a tablet in each room or with the reception (the first could be a premium room feature vs the latter is a normal room).

</a>
</li>
<li>
  Tie-ups with one restaurant for each of the four categories
 </li>
<li>
  These would not redirect to their websites, but to potentially APIs exported by the infra from these restaurants (or an aggregator like zomato). Some restaurants and food service providers already have a good backend such as Mast Kalandar,
  <a href="www.freshmenu.com">
   freshmenu
  </a>
  ,
  <a href="www.spoonjoy.com">
   spoonjoy
  </a>
  , etc to which you should be able to link.
 </li>
<li>
  Why not a web-site? And why API driven? I would want the tablet to be aware of my service apartment address and room number, and also, have the ability to add the bill amount to my hotel bill. So all, I would need to do is to browse, and click. End of story.
 </li>
<li>
  Stringent SLA for delivery and quality of food can be established (failing which - you cease to be a preferred partner and will be swapped out to competition).
 </li>
</ol>
I sense a business opportunity here as well. This need not be something that hotel chains like
<a href="http://www.oyorooms.com">
 oyorooms
</a>
or
<a href="http://www.stayzilla.com/">
 stayzilla
</a>
need to build. This could be very well be an independent platform. Well, somebody like
<a href="www.zomato.com">
 zomato
</a>
can potentially build it though.
